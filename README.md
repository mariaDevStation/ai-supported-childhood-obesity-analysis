Overview

This project explores long-term trends in childhood overweight and physical inactivity among adolescents across selected European countries using publicly available World Health Organization (WHO) data.
The analysis focuses on identifying high-level patterns, differences between countries, and potential areas of concern, while explicitly avoiding causal claims. The project demonstrates responsible data analysis, critical interpretation, and transparent use of AI as a supporting tool rather than a decision-maker.

Data Sources (WHO)

All data used in this project was sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory:

Childhood overweight prevalence (ages 5–19)

Insufficient physical activity among adolescents (ages 11–17)

Data was aggregated at country level and covered the period 2001–2016, which represents the overlapping time window available for both indicators.

Countries included in the analysis:

United Kingdom

Poland

Sweden

France

Croatia

Objective

The objective of this project was to:

Examine trends in childhood overweight and adolescent physical inactivity over time

Compare patterns across countries with different social and environmental contexts

Explore whether changes in physical activity levels align with changes in overweight prevalence

Practise responsible interpretation of population-level health data, including uncertainty and limitations

This project is exploratory and analytical in nature, not predictive or prescriptive.

Method (Human + AI)
Human-led analysis

Data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation were performed manually in Excel

Pivot tables and charts were used to visualise trends over time and across countries

All interpretations, conclusions, and limitations were identified and written manually

Care was taken to avoid causal language and overgeneralisation

AI-assisted support

AI (ChatGPT / Copilot-style tools) was used selectively to:

Summarise high-level trends once charts were created

Check clarity and neutrality of written insights

Assist with structuring observations (e.g. separating insights, limitations, and conclusions)

AI was not used to:

Interpret raw data independently

Draw conclusions without human review

Make recommendations or policy claims

Final judgement, framing, and ethical responsibility remained entirely human-led.

Key Insights

Childhood overweight trends vary considerably across countries, with some showing steady increases and others remaining relatively stable.

Insufficient physical activity among adolescents remains consistently high across all analysed countries throughout the observed period.

In some cases, changes in physical activity levels do not align directly with changes in childhood overweight prevalence.

Sweden shows a notable increase in childhood overweight over time, which coincides with a rise in physical inactivity from around 2009.

At a population level, lower physical activity does not necessarily translate into higher childhood overweight prevalence, suggesting the influence of additional factors.

Risks & Limitations

Obesity data from 1990–2000 was excluded due to the absence of corresponding physical activity data.

The analysis covers a limited time window (2001–2016); more recent trends may differ.

Age ranges differ between indicators (overweight: ages 5–19; physical activity: ages 11–17), limiting direct comparability.

Data is aggregated at country level and cannot explain individual behaviour or causal mechanisms.

Observed associations should not be interpreted as evidence of causation.

Ethical Considerations

The project uses only publicly available, aggregated data, with no personal or identifiable information.

Findings are presented cautiously to avoid stigma, blame, or oversimplification of complex public health issues.

AI was used transparently and responsibly, with human accountability retained for all interpretations.

Conclusions are framed to support understanding, not judgement or policy prescription.

Transferability to Business Contexts

Although based on public health data, the analytical approach used in this project is transferable to many business and technology contexts, including:

Risk and assurance: distinguishing correlation from causation and documenting uncertainty

Data-informed decision support: using trends to inform questions rather than dictate answers

Responsible AI use: combining AI-assisted summarisation with human judgement and accountability

Stakeholder communication: presenting complex data clearly while acknowledging limitations

Regulated environments: working with incomplete data, constraints, and audit-ready reasoning

This project demonstrates structured thinking, ethical awareness, and disciplined analysis — skills applicable to technology, consulting, governance, and data-focused roles.
